# Multi-Disease Prediction System

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a multi-disease prediction system using deep learning (CNN) and machine learning (Random Forest algorithm). The system predicts the likelihood of five diseases: breast cancer, skin cancer, brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease, and pneumonia. It provides a user-friendly interface using Flask for easy interaction.

## Features
- Prediction of five diseases: breast cancer, skin cancer, brain tumor, Alzheimer's disease, and pneumonia.
- Utilizes deep learning (CNN) for image-based disease prediction.
- Web interface powered by Flask for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest algorithm)
- Flask

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Multi-Disease-Prediction-System
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Access the web interface in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Upload an image (for image-based prediction) or enter relevant data (for non-image-based prediction) to get the predicted likelihood of each disease.
